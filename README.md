## README

This repo contains the source code used to generate my personal website. The website is 
made using R, Python and Quarto. 


## Acknowledgement :love:

- Thanks to the [quarto brand theming extension](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-mcanouil) by the
  Quarto Wizard [`@mcanouil`](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-mcanouil) for providing a nice theme.

- Got the idea of parsing the publications using Python and generate listing in HTML from this
  [personal website repo](https://github.com/Jhsmit/website_quarto/) by [`@Jhsmit`](https://github.com/Jhsmit).
