    "text": "I’m a data scientist and statistician who enjoys turning complex data problems into clear, actionable insights. My work spans machine learning, causal inference, and experimentation, and I love thinking about how we can use statistical reasoning to guide real product and business decisions. I spend a lot of time designing experiments and developing scalable data workflows.\nLately, I’ve been digging deeper into methods at the intersection of causal inference and hierarchical modeling, as well as modern causal ML approaches like metalearners, double machine learning, and causal forests. I’m also very enthusiastic about OSS development: I build R packages, Python packages, and Quarto extensions, and I’m always looking for ways to improve the tools I rely on. R is my first love, but I also work comfortably with Python and SQL, and I’m currently exploring Rust and Julia to broaden my toolkit—mostly because they’re fast!!"
