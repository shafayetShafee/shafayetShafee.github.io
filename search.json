    "text": "What I Do\nI translate complex data problems into clear, actionable insights. My work spans machine learning, causal inference, and experimentation, and I spend a lot of time designing experiments and developing scalable data workflows.\nLately, I’ve been digging deeper into methods at the intersection of causal inference and hierarchical modeling, as well as modern causal ML approaches like metalearners, double machine learning, and causal forests. I’m also very enthusiastic about OSS development: I have developed a few  packages,  packages, and Quarto extensions, and I’m always looking for ways to improve the tools I rely on. R is my first love , but I also work comfortably with Python & SQL , and I’m currently exploring Rust and Julia to broaden my toolkit, mostly because they’re fast !!"
