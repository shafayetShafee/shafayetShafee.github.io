::: {.about-body}


::: {.highlight}

I'm a **Data scientist** and **Statistician** who enjoys using statistical thinking to shape 
real product and business decisions. My interests and expertise lie at the intersection of 
applied statistics, machine learning, and open-source development, turning rigorous analytical 
ideas into practical tools, software and workflows.

## {{< iconify streamline-freehand:office-work-wireless >}} What I Do

I translate complex data problems into clear, actionable insights. My work spans machine 
learning, causal inference, and experimentation, and I spend a lot of time designing experiments 
and developing scalable data workflows.

Lately, I've been digging deeper into methods at the intersection of *causal inference* and
*hierarchical modeling*, as well as modern causal ML approaches like metalearners, 
double machine learning, and causal forests. I'm also very enthusiastic about OSS development: 
I have developed a few {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}}&nbsp;packages, 
{{< iconify carbon:logo-python title="Python" label="Python" >}}&nbsp;packages, and Quarto 
extensions, and I'm always looking for ways to improve the tools I rely on. **R** is my first love
{{< iconify octicon:heart-fill-16 title="Love" label="Love" >}}, but I also work comfortably with 
**Python** & **SQL** {{< iconify mingcute:fire-fill >}}, and I'm currently exploring **Rust** and 
**Julia** to broaden my toolkit, mostly because they're fast

## {{< iconify fluent:window-dev-tools-20-regular >}} Technical Skills

Built on a strong foundation in statistical methodologies, ranging from probability theory, 
statistical inference, and hypothesis testing to survival analysis, multilevel modeling, 
Bayesian methods, and causal inference, I work across the broader landscape of modern data 
science and software development. I build end-to-end data transformation pipelines using 
tools like [**dbt**](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction), bash scripting, manage 
**CI/CD** workflows with *GitHub Actions*, and develop automated reporting dashboards in 
*Google Sheets* using [**Google AppsScript**](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) 
and **BigQuery**, as well as dynamic dashboards in *Looker Studio*.

My experience includes developing and productionizing machine-learning models and pipelines 
with [**Kedro**](https://kedro.org/#why-kedro), [**MLflow**](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/), 
and containerized deployments using [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/). I support polyglot 
data-science workflows with deep expertise in R complemented by effective integration of Python 
when needed.


## {{< iconify raphael:opensource >}} Open Source Contributions

I contribute to open-source projects across R, Python, and the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) 
ecosystem. My work includes developing {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}}&nbsp;packages
such as [**MOR**](https://shafayetshafee.github.io/MOR/) and 
[**skmisc**](https://shafayetshafee.github.io/skmisc/), as well as 
{{< iconify carbon:logo-python title="Python" label="Python" >}}&nbsp;packages like 
[**skmiscpy**](https://skmiscpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for causal effect estimation and 
[**kedrogen**](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/kedrogen), a CLI tool for scaffolding 
reproducible Kedro project structures. I have also developed a range of Quarto extensions 
(e.g., [*downloadthis*](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/downloadthis), 
[*line-highlight*](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/line-highlight), and 
[*interactive-sql*](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/interactive-sql)), using Lua, HTML/CSS, 
and JavaScript to support more efficient and user-friendly scientific publishing workflows.


## {{< iconify simple-icons:researchgate >}} Research & Publications

I have [**one**](publications/index.qmd) peer-reviewed publication in **PLoS ONE** (a Q1 journal), 
where I examined the *causal impact of maternal continuum of care on a child’s minimum acceptable 
diet in Bangladesh*.
