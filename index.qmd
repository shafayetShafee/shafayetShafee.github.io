::: {.about-body}

I'm a **Data scientist** and **Statistician** who enjoys using statistical thinking to shape 
real product and business decisions. My interests and expertise lie at the intersection of 
applied statistics, machine learning, and open-source development, turning rigorous analytical 
ideas into practical tools, software and workflows.


## {{< iconify streamline-freehand:office-work-wireless >}} What I Do

I translate complex data problems into clear, actionable insights. My work spans machine 
learning, causal inference, and experimentation, and I spend a lot of time designing experiments 
and developing scalable data workflows.

Lately, I've been digging deeper into methods at the intersection of *causal inference* and
*hierarchical modeling*, as well as modern causal ML approaches like metalearners, 
double machine learning, and causal forests. I'm also very enthusiastic about OSS development: 
I have developed a few {{< iconify fa7-brands:r-project title="R" label="R" >}}&nbsp;packages, 
{{< iconify carbon:logo-python title="Python" label="Python" >}}&nbsp;packages, and Quarto 
extensions, and I'm always looking for ways to improve the tools I rely on. **R** is my first love
{{< iconify octicon:heart-fill-16 title="Love" label="Love" >}}, but I also work comfortably with 
**Python** & **SQL** {{< iconify mingcute:fire-fill >}}, and I'm currently exploring **Rust** and 
**Julia** to broaden my toolkit, mostly because they're fast
