I'm a data scientist and statistician who enjoys turning complex data problems into 
clear, actionable insights. My work spans machine learning, causal inference, and 
experimentation, and I love thinking about how we can use statistical reasoning to 
guide real product and business decisions. I spend a lot of time designing experiments 
and developing scalable data workflows.

Lately, I've been digging deeper into methods at the intersection of causal inference 
and hierarchical modeling, as well as modern causal ML approaches like metalearners, 
double machine learning, and causal forests. I'm also very enthusiastic about OSS 
development: I build R packages, Python packages, and Quarto extensions, and I'm 
always looking for ways to improve the tools I rely on. R is my first love, but I 
also work comfortably with Python and SQL, and I'm currently exploring Rust and 
Julia to broaden my toolkit—mostly because they're fast!!
